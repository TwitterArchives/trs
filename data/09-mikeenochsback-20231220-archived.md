He wouldn't debate me and Striker on Luke Ford's channel either. And considering that I dismantled him on twitter the other week I doubt he'll talk to me live. <!--985893926975492096-->

Another possible driver of belief in the JQ is the US's lapdog relationship to Israel in foreign policy against our own interest. <!--985892542909747205-->

You say that this is just about Jews being responsible for leftism. It's not. I get that you need that to be the argument in order to knock down your strawman, but it fails. <!--985892052654321664-->

"...ensuring that chemical weapons are not used in any way that pose a risk to U.S. interests, that Islamic State is defeated and that there is a good vantage point to watch what Iran is doing."  It's all so tiresome. <!--985526291033096192-->

Haley's statement is completely incoherent. One of our goals is defeating ISIS? Which is why we intervene every time Assad is about to do that. Ok. <!--985524620437655554-->

I have told this to Republicans before and even shown them data like this and their only response is a thousand yard stare. https://twitter.com/rp_griffin/status/985281958359064578 <!--985512675919781889-->

It's one thing to countersignal "blackpillers" for freaking out, quite another to start channeling Bill Kristol. <!--985329172959649792-->

* [14 April 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20180414210521/https://twitter.com/mikeenochsback/status/985262752410324994): We're now conditioned to see these shitty scraps from the table as if they are wins. Well, he talked tough on immigration in that tweet, well he didn't INVADE Syria, he just bombed them in a limited strike. Look he hasn't been impeached yet. Look he BTFO Comey on twitter etc. <!--985262752410324994-->
* [14 April 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20180414210242/https://twitter.com/mikeenochsback/status/985262085734125569): What gets lost in all this is what the base, white Americans, wanted and voted for. We don't get a wall, we don't get defunding sanctuary cities, we do get more H1B visas. We get stagnation on border security and immigration and watered down neoconism on foreign policy. <!--985262085734125569-->
* [14 April 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20180414205804/https://twitter.com/mikeenochsback/status/985260920204079106): What's really is gonna happen is that the pressure on him is gonna increase from the investigation, and now he'll be taunted from the left for launching toothless strikes to wag the dog, and the neocons will pat him on the back for a day and then go back to undermining him. <!--985260920204079106-->
* [14 April 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20180414205553/https://twitter.com/mikeenochsback/status/985260371459166208): I'm guessing he calculated that by "getting tough" he could split the Jewish community and appeal to the warhawk neocon faction to lessen the pressure from the investigation. But in the end they all would have rather had Hillary, who was a much more reliable neolib and neocon. <!--985260371459166208-->
* [14 April 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20180414205213/https://twitter.com/mikeenochsback/status/985259449370730499): This is a "wag the dog" not in the sense that Trump is trying to distract the public from his scandals, but in the sense that he is trying to recruit one faction of Jews, the neocons, to help him against another faction of Jews, It's not gonna work. They all still want him gone. <!--985259449370730499-->
* [14 April 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20180414193436/https://twitter.com/mikeenochsback/status/985239915997917184): I cringe not only at the thought that there are people are stupid enough to buy this, but that people with bad motives know that there are people stupid enough to buy this. <!--985239915997917184-->

The only possible explanation is Russian bots! Seems legit. https://twitter.com/jseldin/status/985199373767323650 <!--985239451277381632-->

I'm on for the first hour on Syria. Second hour is on the Mueller probe and DC shenanigans.   https://therightstuff.biz/2018/04/14/fash-the-nation-117-neocon-don/  pic.twitter.com/9BiwfFvad2 <!--985220770753368065-->

He's already being accused of doing limited strikes to distract from domestic issues. How long before they say he colluded with Putin? The only winning move is not to play. <!--985207544699408388-->
* [14 April 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20180414172247/https://twitter.com/mikeenochsback/status/985206742496808965): This is why the logic of the "symbolic strike" fails. If you bomb a country and you don't do any damage, then why do it? It makes you look dumb to everyone. It's an obviously strategically incoherent move and is indicative of a schizophrenic White House. Just say no to neocons. https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/985124774643994624 <!--985206742496808965-->

No, that's retarded. This was a capitulation to exactly the people that are ginning up these scandals, and now that they've seen it works expect them to escalate. <!--985204613673517057-->

* [14 April 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20180414165346/https://twitter.com/mikeenochsback/status/985199439513051137): This narrative on the normie right is never going to die unless we destroy it. It's too tempting of a way out of the minefield set by leftist race politics for normie whites not to bite on. We need to spread the truth to them or they will keep falling for this. https://twitter.com/charliekirk11/status/985167952470265858 <!--985199439513051137-->

That way her small number of non alt-right readers can see me and Ann being totally reasonable while she froths at the mouth with anti-white hate. https://twitter.com/EyesOnTheRight/status/985177195281879041 <!--985192376258957312-->

Not only does diversity inherently destroy trust, but the specific groups that are increasing in the US are low trust even when homogeneous.

That sucks for you, but that doesn't change the fact that there is a core idea of a white person.

Muslims are a protected class in Europe that you can get in trouble for criticizing. Would you agree that the same is true of Jews?

The point is whether or not the US has an elite class that perpetuates its ideology through state institutions. MLK in the schools is an example.

That's weird. Also, JF is a public figure and he is suing, so not sure what you're getting at. Unless you're saying he's not a public figure, which means he has a lower burden of proof.

In the course of writing,  @RichardFausset  probably grew to actually like Tony and on some level his conscience kicked in and he couldn't just smear him.
