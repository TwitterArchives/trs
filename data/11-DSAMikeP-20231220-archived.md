Has that changed? <!--1176278050021027840-->

When I criticized environmentalism the other day, I got some pushback despite making sure to differentiate the current political ideology of environmentalism from genuine efforts at conservation and preservation. https://twitter.com/ReadKaczynski/status/1176252913104171008 <!--1176268487532130304-->

It doesn't matter, because if white people, and you know who we are, decide to act collectively, we don't need permission from anyone, nor do we need to pass some kind of test to meet your approval for when it is appropriate to do so or not. <!--1176221443744501760-->

Both are losing their countries to immigration. 2. Both are called racist if they want to fix it. 3. Jews control the media and politics in both countries. 4. In America there is effectively no difference. https://twitter.com/SeanJuanDaDon/status/1176135859361460224 <!--1176220880357249024-->

* [23 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190923053623/https://twitter.com/DSAMikeP/status/1176006815932452864): This is basically the process by which I arrived at my present conclusions. That plus my instinctive horror at the thought of a world without white people. <!--1176006815932452864-->
* [23 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190923052846/https://twitter.com/DSAMikeP/status/1176004895960436736): Ok. I'm just saying. <!--1176004895960436736-->
* [23 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190923052605/https://twitter.com/DSAMikeP/status/1176004222149697536): The very fact that basically all discourse around this group of people is highly conditioned, and statements which fall outside the basic conditioning are a minefield that could end in social and economic ostracism, is significant and something to think about. <!--1176004222149697536-->
* [23 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190923052343/https://twitter.com/DSAMikeP/status/1176003624205504512): I have found that when talking to gentiles about this, that argument comes up often. "Yes, they are rich and powerful and you can barely even speak of them without trouble, but they were once persecuted!" I don't think people even realize they do this. IMO it's conditioning. <!--1176003624205504512-->
* [23 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190923052008/https://twitter.com/DSAMikeP/status/1176002720689479680): Ok, but you get my point that this doesn't say anything about their power now. On top of that I reject the idea that even if they were super persecuted this necessitates some kind of process of historical justice whereby they are granted a period of dominance. <!--1176002720689479680-->
* [23 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190923051016/https://twitter.com/DSAMikeP/status/1176000238080933888): I don't really know about those claims, so I can't say for sure. But I will say that Italy was never the center of their power, which was in the East, Germany, Russia, Poland and then later in Britain and the US. <!--1176000238080933888-->
* [23 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190923050457/https://twitter.com/DSAMikeP/status/1175998902975258626): One theory states that Christopher Columbus was a marrano, another says that the Medici family were marranos. That would be particularly interesting since it would mean that Pope Leo X, the seller of indulgences, was a Jew. <!--1175999452680773632-->
* [23 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190923050457/https://twitter.com/DSAMikeP/status/1175998902975258626): Which doesn't mean they didn't have power. It just means the common people weren't big fans of them. This is a common theme of their existence. They make alliances with power, not the common folk. I don't know much about Jews in Italy, though there are lots of rumors of conversos <!--1175998902975258626-->
* [23 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190923044928/https://twitter.com/DSAMikeP/status/1175995538505945088): > I don’t think we can reduce to one convenient monolithic enemy  It's not convenient. And I challenge you to find another context in which you would advocate for not identifying and prioritizing problems and instead treating them like a mass of disordered issues. <!--1175995538505945088-->
* [23 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190923044625/https://twitter.com/DSAMikeP/status/1175994233850925058): Organized Jewry, or zionism if you like, is the most powerful force in the world right now and it exerts its control most completely in the US and Western Europe. The fact that other problems exist does not diminish this glaring fact. <!--1175994233850925058-->
* [23 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190923044012/https://twitter.com/DSAMikeP/status/1175992666108174336): The supposed centuries of persecution is a lie. There is a complex history here and it involves expulsions as well as times when Jews enjoyed special protected status from the state. Yes, their power seeking traits likely are a result of the evolutionary pressures placed on them. <!--1175992666108174336-->
* [23 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190923043509/https://twitter.com/DSAMikeP/status/1175991397981331456): I understand that there are various social and psychological roadblocks and costs to accepting this, much less repeating it. But it's simply the truth of who the ruling class in our country is. Don't get mad at me about it. I don't like it any more than anyone else. <!--1175991397981331456-->
* [23 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190923043032/https://twitter.com/DSAMikeP/status/1175990253431209984): There are corrupt people of all races in America. But Jews exert a level of systemic and organized control that no other group does. The moral narratives that drive US power, fighting nazism, the holocaust, diversity etc. are jew-centric and given to us by jewish intellectuals. <!--1175990253431209984-->
* [23 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190923042229/https://twitter.com/DSAMikeP/status/1175988212281597953): You may balk at this, but think about it. What do you need to do to get the US government and political class to really sit up and take notice? To get them to discard red tape and liberal priors and swing into action? Tell them that somewhere, somehow a jew is being hurt. <!--1175988212281597953-->
* [23 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190923041511/https://twitter.com/DSAMikeP/status/1175986374832472065): The US government is only good for one thing. Protecting jewish interests. In all other duties it will fail, allow things to fall into bureaucratic boondoggles or handwave them away forever. <!--1175986374832472065-->
* [23 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190923041215/https://twitter.com/DSAMikeP/status/1175985638111416322): No one can imagine solutions, because solutions don't exist within the liberal frame of thinking. Our government will only take decisive and authoritarian action when it comes to white nationalists and other perceived enemies of jews. <!--1175985638111416322-->
* [23 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190923040418/https://twitter.com/DSAMikeP/status/1175983639475232768): It's really amazing how our society simply can't handle these sorts of problems at all, and no one really believes that they even can be handled. Americans of 100 years would be absolutely appalled at what has been allowed to happen to our cities. <!--1175983639475232768-->
* [23 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190923035823/https://twitter.com/DSAMikeP/status/1175982153630453761): Liberalism refuses to allow decent white people any exclusive spaces, and then it refuses to properly handle the dregs of humanity that it insists must be allowed to exist anywhere for the sake of "human rights." The result is shit all over the once beautiful streets. <!--1175982153630453761-->
* [23 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190923035326/https://twitter.com/DSAMikeP/status/1175980904994545665): And in most big western cities it's not Indians that are doing the street shitting, the ones over here probably use bathrooms. It's the homeless blacks and various heroin users that previously would have been literally rounded up and put in state facilities. <!--1175981278950301696-->
* [23 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190923035326/https://twitter.com/DSAMikeP/status/1175980904994545665): I don't blame the individual store owner as much as I do the city. I wouldn't let these people use my bathroom either. The issue is the culture of liberalism that pervades these cities. <!--1175980904994545665-->
* [23 September 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190923035006/https://twitter.com/DSAMikeP/status/1175980059259285504): Yes. And why did stores start doing this, when previously they could allow people to use their bathrooms? Why will no major city in the US even have public restrooms anywhere anymore? I think we all know. <!--1175980059259285504-->

So perhaps a movie where a goy is excited to join a movement and draw strength, and is then let down and goes back to be being isolated when it is revealed to him it was all fake, is a very satisfying result for them. <!--1171289484962553857-->

That is far less popular than Tommy. <!--1135068177757609984-->

Historically UKIP was a libertarian party with a full range of policy positions. Farage has advocated a "commonwealth first" immigration policy for years, which is not a popular position. <!--1135067818674860033-->

Farage himself literally said he was just that when he came in to wreck UKIP after they made Tommy Robinson a party member. Farage himself said that this was what he was doing. Don't ask me, ask him. <!--1135066010179055616-->

For one, I didn't defend Sargon on everything as he seems to say. I defended him from the specific claim that he sank UKIP, it was Farage that did that.

I see a deracinated bugman fascinated with a huge spectacle that he doesn't understand the significance of. He's reacting like he's watching the latest Avengers movie. pic.twitter.com/Sgcd926hGW <!--1118244493625569285-->

Arson is completely plausible. And the state has a motive to cover it up if it were done by certain protected groups. <!--1117963812915884033-->

All of us want this to have been a deliberate act by one of any number of evil groups that hate white people. That way at least it fits into a grand storyline, which in the future could include just retribution. It is so much worse if it was just an accident. <!--1117963473940561920-->
