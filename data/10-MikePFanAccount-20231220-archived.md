You wouldn't want to lose your head over a social outrage mob and end up in trouble here. <!--1102414228714110982-->

The media takes zero interest but is focusing like a laser on some kids playing beer pong at a party. The media is not about reporting news, and it's not even about clicks. This video would get plenty of clicks. https://twitter.com/DaheelR/status/1029380961639821312 <!--1102407555278610432-->

I hope I'm wrong. But every defense should be made of these kids and people engaging in harassment should be called out and documented. <!--1102394968172306434-->

Why would the Norks torture him when they don't torture Americans as a matter of policy, and they had every reason to try to keep him alive? <!--1101736066887880704-->

The hanging attempt is my own speculation since I dunno where he would get those pills over there. Either way, the most likely scenario is suicide attempt. <!--1101734018440200194-->

Everyone that says he was beaten, that his teeth were pulled, that he was brutally murdered by Mr. Kim is lying. <!--1101733598712025088-->

Warmbier was brain dead when he got back to the US, most likely because he tried to hang himself. There was no evidence of physical trauma and the other Americans in NK are being treated well. https://www.gq.com/story/otto-warmbier-north-korea-american-hostage-true-story <!--1101732914109313026-->

And unlike RAM, who were obviously defending themselves, there is zero question that this was an aggressive assault. <!--1101686476876775429-->

Icke was surprised to hear this, as he had never thought of it before. Makes you think. https://twitter.com/TravLeBlanc/status/1100941593727692800 <!--1101403844293079046-->

To be forced to publicly abase himself before a Jewish woman after the Jewish community has treated him so badly. What a loser. <!--1063847707717058560-->

Why would they not want one of their top products in their own country? https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/porn-sites-blocked-adult-websites-israel-law-bill-ban-opt-in-out-a7389271.html <!--1063845936869384197-->

Acosta is not being accused of any crime or civil violation that would entitle him to due process. Unless being an asshole in public is a crime. I can live with that if they can. <!--1063467616709296128-->

So you come up with some talmudry to justify a "limited" ruling to get what you want. Asshole. https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/416935-judge-rules-against-white-house-in-cnn-dispute <!--1063466244857348098-->

"It's the right thing to do regardless of politics." "This is true leadership." "Van Jones gave Trump a shoutout." etc. This is why conservatives lose. Nothing is apolitical.

My recommendation remains to steer clear of these people, because defending yourself from their attacks has landed innocent people in jail. <!--1063115628985438209-->

Zero. They are breaking the law and he is top cop. DO IT OR STFU. <!--1063114908588482560-->

Trump is the fucking President. He is the top law enforcement officer in the country. He can order an investigation into Antifa terrorists at any time. So fucking do it instead of just flapping your mouth. <!--1063112516761542666-->

Don't say things like this if you are going to let your AG prosecute innocent people for defending themselves. We need action, not talk.
