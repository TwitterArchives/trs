* [ 1 October 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201001074443/https://twitter.com/Aarick20/status/1311562231600033792): While I'm glad election year Trump is giving these people some attention, let me remind you that Kavanaugh and Gorsuch led a conservative majority to give corporations even more leeway to gamble away people's pensions. https://twitter.com/DelphiRetirees/status/1311317719699148801 <!--1311562231600033792-->
* [ 1 October 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201001174625/https://twitter.com/Aarick20/status/1311555247622565890): For Newsom, the "optics" (I hate that cursed term) look pretty horrible.   This wankers whole act is based on "RESISTING" Trump. This bill getting on his desk around the time Trump is attacking CRT is a coincidence.   His Jew donors write op-eds calling for veto and they got it. https://twitter.com/Aarick20/status/1311549380957294592 <!--1311555247622565890-->

Except for Jews. 🙄 https://twitter.com/Aarick20/status/1311549990133784576 <!--1311550590179254272-->

Instead they are included as white, and thus opened up to the racial abuse they support for real whites.   One of Newsom's top donors, Zionist Jew Roselyn Swig, personally intervened to kill this bill. https://twitter.com/Aarick20/status/1311549380957294592 <!--1311549990133784576-->

His personal life is obscene, he's rude, he has more in common with a mob boss than any predecessor.   This is part of Trump's charm. But Brooks Brothers Youth throwing terms like "wignat" around suffer from severe cognitive dissonance. <!--1311520214253674497-->

He has to delicately balance what Jewish donors want with getting the votes he needs to win. https://national-justice.com/trump-needs-white-nationalist-votes-and-he-knows-it <!--1311502136639922178-->

After failing to bait WNs, they seem to have expanded the "movements" ideology to include libertarians, ancaps, leftists, etc.  2) Boogaloo is an idea, not an organization. https://twitter.com/kenklippenstein/status/1311455920212377601 <!--1311475100756123648-->

Some of these people, like Senator Susan Collins, are very far behind in their races. Make sure they don't get re-elected in November. https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/09/30/us/presidential-debate?action=click&module=Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage <!--1311455609137639425-->

As a 501(c)(3) the ADL is explicitly forbidden from campaigning or endorsing candidates. This is really pushing the limit. https://twitter.com/ReallyAmerican1/status/1311442553829568513 <!--1311448566599217152-->

REAL LIFE IS A MARVEL COMIC AND YOU'RE BAD AND I'M GOOD" <!--1311414895813033988-->

But if your "activism" is made up of getting working class fathers fired, assaulting people, or framing people for crimes using disinformation...what do you expect? https://twitter.com/gwensnyderPHL/status/1311409946525872129 <!--1311413460018827266-->

They dont call genocidal ethnocentrists who run South African or Israeli government fascists.  *Jews will occasionally call Syria, Iran or the Chinese fascist when they get in their way. https://twitter.com/KegzK/status/1311392780426633218 <!--1311405990898737153-->

The rare occasion someone on the right articulates what people are thinking, you have optics cucking consultants/plausible denialists jumping in with "Actually, he never said 'both sides'! Actually, he misspoke!" <!--1311338002959007749-->

White nationalists aren't the terrorists.   These optics cucks are insufferable. What do you assholes add to the debate other than obfuscation/"plausible deniability"? https://twitter.com/charliekirk11/status/1311188824844718081 <!--1311336876633190407-->

A transsexual who likes low taxes is way more welcome in the Republican Party than a normal heterosexual white man who doesn't hate himself. https://twitter.com/MsBlaireWhite/status/1311128039527297024 <!--1311335062328270849-->

They gave in to Jews. Now normal people must hide. <!--1311329358683013120-->

Jews are VERY mad.   If he does it, he's an absolute moron. Everyone that would vote for him is either sympathetic to white nationalism or doesn't give a shit. <!--1311327725077123074-->

The anarchists who were defeated in Charlottesville also deserved it. Were it not for the nationalists, they would've done what they're doing now.  Everybody knows Trump is right. https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1311268302950260737 <!--1311326659400826882-->

I was honestly expecting him to condemn white nationalists, which would lose him the election. He did the smart thing and turned it around on antifa/anarchists  Meanwhile Biden was distancing himself from the extreme left the whole debate. He will lose. <!--1311187717598965761-->

But this one celebrates by ruthlessly inflicting pain on outsiders.
